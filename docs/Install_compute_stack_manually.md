# Compute Stack

The Nevermined Data In-Situ Computation (DISC) stack can be installed via Nevermined tools (for local deployments) or manually.
In this page we are gonna see how to install all the components required manually step by step.

The Nevermined DISC stack requires:

* A Kubernetes cluster manager. Here we use `minikube`
* Argo Server
* Argo Workflows
* Minio
